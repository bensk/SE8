		<h1>Sound Logger</h1>
		<!--Here is the start of my intro div-->
		<div id="intro">
				<p>
						We have been learning about electronics in Software Engineering. We’ve built, designed and coded with a programmable circuit board called “Arduino”. “Arduino” is also a software to program circuits. The most interesting thing I’ve built this unit is the
						temperature sensor circuit board. The temperature sensor is a type of circuit you measure temperature in. The sensor does not even look like a thermometer. We needed to code the circuit so we opened up a the software, a program that runs code, and
						learned a new feature called the serial monitor. It is located in the top right corner that looks like a magnifying glass we pressed after we coded and build the circuit and it shows us the temperature in fahrenheit and celsius.</p>

				<p>We read an article about the issue about the issue of noise in the classroom. I learned that it’s not just loud noises that can be a problem, but also, softer noises, because it causes stress and distractions.</p>
				<p>To learn more about the noise in our school, we are building and programming Sound Loggers. These devices will measure sound levels in different classroom throughout the school. This will help us to see where the noises come from and how we can help
						prevent those noises from causing stress or distractions. Also the next thing you need to know is that students are not knowing what we are supposed to do just for noises you can bearly hear. </p>
				<p>The sound logger will contain a microphone, clock, and SD card. The reason we are going to put a microphone is because we need to listen to the sounds in the classroom and record them. </p>

				<p>After we measure the sound, we will analyze it using our math and software engineering skills.</p>

				<p>We would like to install a sensor in your classroom, if you permit us to.</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
			
			<p><em>In this section, summarize the information from the article. Why is sound an issue in the classroom? What are surprising pieces of information from the article.? What do many teachers believe about sound in the classroom?</em></p>
				<p>According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XmlA6o-8D5iB7t-Vv7yP6Pit4aUG8rMMAQTVz6Co4yA/pub">Low-Level Classroom Noise Distracts, Experts Say"</a> by Sarah Sparks, noise in the classroom can have negative effects on students.
						

						 <p> Studys show that students who have higher background noise levels during school "perform significantly worse" on test than other students who have lower background noise levels in school.</p> 

    <p> However, even though though this is true. Lower noise levels stick have a great effect on distraction and stress.</p>
    
    <p> For example, another study shown in "Low-Level Classroom Noise Distracts, Experts Say" says that many students were distracted by T.V noises next door even though it was "barely hearable". This had caused the students to lose focus of their concentration. </p>

				<h2>Designing the Circuit</h2>
				<p>We designed and built custom parts to use with an Arduino. Earlier in the unit, we used pre-built parts, but for our sound logger, we needed to build a microphone, an SD card holder, and a clock</p>
				<h3>Parts</h3>
				<p>In this section, explain why we needed each of these parts, and how we
						<mark>soldered</mark> them together. Be sure to explain what
						<mark>soldering</mark> is.</p>
				<p>Our Sound Logger consisted of three main components:</p>
				<ol>
						<li><b>Microphone</b> This was the most important component, necessary to measure sound levels. </li>
						<li><b>SD Card</b> We could have just logged data to a computer, but that would've required a computer near the sound logger in every room. Instead, we built an SD card reader, so that data could be stored on a removeable card.</li>
						<li><b>Clock</b> This component was also not necessary, but was very useful in order to know what time a noise was happening. Otherwise, we would need to add up 10 second increments in order to get to the time that we wanted.</li>
				</ol>

		<div id="data">
				<h2>Data</h2>
				<h3>Room May 18<sup>th</sup> Sound Levels</h3>
				<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvhdU4nbp5WSZXvc_9wUE7xXNoWe47tESoPBkLJdmGY/pubchart?oid=657562011&amp;format=interactive" width=600px height=380px></iframe>
			<p>Our data indicates that the loudest class in Room 300 is 9<sup>th</sup> Grade Economics. This can be seen in the raised sound levels between 10:15AM and 11AM.</p>
				<p>There were two very loud spikes- one at 9:45AM and one at 12:30PM. These were 10 times louder than any other noise observed during the day. I hypothesize that these were either a door slamming, or something directly impacting the microphone (which
						rested on a table at the front of the room)</p>
			<h3>Sources of Error</h3>
			<p>Our sound loggers were placed in five different classrooms. These rooms are in use for different periods throughout the day. Some rooms are empty for some periods, while other rooms are used the entire day. This will impact the average sound observed in each rooms, because empty rooms are significantly quieter than rooms with students.</p>
			<p>Another possible source of error is damage or tampering with the sensors. Once they were placed in classrooms, they were inspected once a day, but frequently had to be replaced or fixed after suffering minor damage. This caused gaps in the data, which impacted our results.</p>
