# Dot Notation
# Let's take a closer look at why you use len(string) and str(object), but dot notation (such as "String".upper()) for the rest.

lion = "roar"
print len(lion)
print lion.upper()
# Methods that use dot notation only work with strings.

# On the other hand, len() and str() can work on other data types.

# Instructions
# On line 3, call the len() function with the argument ministry.
print len("ministry")
# On line 4, invoke the ministry's .upper() function.
